## Apple Orchards
You are an entrepreneur in Indiana and want to create an apple picking orchard to create a family legacy. Part of your new venture involves understanding when to plant new apple trees and to remove apple trees coming up on their expiration.

Let's build on everyone's favorite challenge: [Apple Trees!](https://github.com/novemberplatoon/apple-trees). Feel free to use the instructor solution as a starting point.

### Apple Orchard Implementation

1. An AppleOrchard should be able to tell me how many AppleTrees are alive
2. An AppleOrchard should be able to plant new AppleTrees
3. An AppleOrchard should be able to bulldoze dead AppleTrees
4. An AppleOrchard should be able to tell me how many AppleTrees are producing fruit
5. An AppleOrchard should be able to tell me how many AppleTrees are not producing fruit
6. An AppleOrchard should be able to tell me how many Apples there are at any given time
7. An AppleOrchard should be able to tell me the average diameter of all the Apples grown
